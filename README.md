# Bender Robotics Extendable Autonomous CHasis (BREACH)

## A bit of info
- `sys` folder contains useful scripts for installation on new robot/PC
- `sw` folder contains catkin_ws with everything needed for new robot

NOTE: If a compilation of new packages fails, remove unnecessary packages (namely for realsense camera), they may be obsolete and can fail the compilation!
